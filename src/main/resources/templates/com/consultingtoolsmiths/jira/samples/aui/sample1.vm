    <h3>Sample 1 Success</h3>

    <p>
      This page shows the HTML sample from <a href="http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/AUI/Getting+Started+with+AUI">Getting Started with AUI</a>. The HTML was added directly in this velocity template file.
    </p>

    <p>
      When you add a class attribute to an HTML element, it can be used by css and javascript. class="foo bar". Classnames should not start with a number. Some js init function will update the event handlers for the elements with the class ane.

      It's useful to inspect the HTML of this entire page. Make sure your browser doesn't have extensions enabled that are adding anything unexpected. Also see https://studio.atlassian.com/source/browse/~raw,r=65554/AJS/trunk/auiplugin/src/demo/index.html

    <script type="text/javascript">
AJS.dropDown.Standard({
  trigger: ".gadget .aui-dd-trigger",
  dropDown: ".gadget .aui-dropdown",
  selectionHandler: function() {
  this.hide();
  },
  align: "right"
});
   </script>


    <p>
      This doesn't work: TODO perhaps needs markup and js?
